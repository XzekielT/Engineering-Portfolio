## Entry 001

**Date: 12/20/2025**  
**Objective:** Evaluate feasibility of hot-plate-based temperature-accelerated aging.

**What changed:**  
Confirmed access to Python, MATLAB, and potential use of a consumer hot plate for thermal stress.

**What we learned:**  
Hot plate–based aging is feasible if actual device temperature is independently measured and documented.

**Decisions:**  
Proceed with hot-plate thermal aging approach pending component selection and temperature verification method.

**Next experiments:**  
Select component type and identify temperature measurement method (thermocouple or thermometer).

**Open questions:**  
What component provides the clearest failure metric under thermal stress?
